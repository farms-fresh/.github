## Hi there 👋

We are passionate about bringing the best local grocery shopping experience to everyone. We believe that food can be made cheaper and healthier by removing all the middle parties involved between farms and customers (i.e. grocery stores). We are on a mission to bring great food to you and help farmer communities thrive.
